# Warehouse-ABM-and-RL

This thesis investigates the potential of integrating sensor-based mapping systems and reinforcement learning (RL) models to enhance logistical eﬃciency and energy conservation within industrial warehouse environments. Ineﬃciencies in conventional warehouse operations, particularly those related to excessive forklift travel distances and energy consumption, pose significant operational and environmental challenges. By leveraging real-time sensor data and autonomous decision-making models, this research aims to address these issues while reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

The study is divided into two primary components: an agent-based simulated dynamic model
employing sensor-based mapping systems and an RL optimization model designed to balance safety
and energy eﬃciency. Through extensive simulations, the sensor-based systems demonstrated marked improvements in operational eﬃciency, with forklifts guided by real-time data showing significant reductions in travel time, energy consumption, and overall operational costs. These models proved to be scalable across diﬀerent warehouse layouts, highlighting their adaptability and potential for broad industrial application.

Reinforcement learning models were applied to optimize autonomous forklift operations, revealing critical trade-oﬀs between safety and energy eﬃciency. By adjusting the reward function the research explored various scenarios, from prioritizing energy eﬃciency at the expense of safety to balancing both parameters eﬀectively. The RL models showed consistent improvement over time, achieving Pareto optimality, wherein no model could improve in one dimension (safety or energy) without negatively aﬀecting the other.

The findings also highlight important considerations regarding the broader sustainability of these technologies. While operational eﬃciency gains are clear, the computational power required to train and maintain machine learning models presents its own environmental challenges. Data centers that power these models consume significant energy, potentially oﬀsetting some of the environmental benefits achieved through operational optimization. Furthermore, the ”rebound eﬀect”, wherein increased eﬃciency could lead to greater production output and, consequently, higher energy consumption, must be carefully managed to prevent negating long-term sustainability goals.

This thesis concludes that the integration of sensor-based mapping systems and RL models holds
significant potential to revolutionize warehouse logistics by improving operational eﬃciency, reducing energy consumption, and contributing to environmental sustainability. However, realizing the full environmental benefits of these technologies requires balancing their operational gains with sustainable growth practices, ensuring that eﬃciency improvements do not inadvertently lead to greater environmental impact.
